# PHP binary flags

This is a simple extension to create PHP flags that act like keyword arguments. A flag is a constant defining an integer that can be use for bitwise operations (combined with other flags) and provide multiple configuration entries in one variable. Read more about underlying concept in the [documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.bitwise.php).

For now, this extension only provides object-oriented flags.
